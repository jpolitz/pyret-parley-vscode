Borrows heavily from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/custom-editor-sample

To run, open in VScode and:

```
npm i
npm run compile
```

Press F5 and choose to run as an extension, then open a .arr file

NB this is running Pyret-of-today (not anchor). If you open up a `.parley` file you'll get that editor, but it doesn't sync with the filesystem yet.
